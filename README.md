This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript where type coercion leads to a runtime error that isn't caught during compilation. The `add` function is designed to accept two numbers but doesn't explicitly prevent string arguments.  The solution involves adding runtime type checking to ensure that only numbers are used.
